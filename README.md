# NOTEd

## NOTEd is a note taking app created using React JS. The app responds to user inputs through the use of UseState Hooks. 

You can find a hosted version of this app here: https://react-to-do-li.herokuapp.com/

<br>
Click the input field to type a title for your first note, then click the + button to add your first note. 

From there, you can add more notes, or delete any of your current notes. 

<br>
Because I used this project to practice React JS, it does not have an attached database and your notes will be lost when you restart your session. 
<br>

<br>
In future versions: <br>
[  ] Database Support so that notes are saved <br>
[  ] An edit feature
