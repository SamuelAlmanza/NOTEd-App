#NOTEd# 

NOTEd is a note taking app created using React JS. The app responds to user inputs through the use of UseState Hooks. 

Click the input field to type a title for your first note, then click the + button to add your first note. 

From there, you can add more notes, or delete any of your current notes. 


Because I used this project to practice React JS, it does not have an attached database and your notes will be lost when you restart your session.  

In future versions, I would like to add a DB as well as edit functionality.
